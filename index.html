imagine a loop over a number. Pick a number between 1,000 and 3,000?

1596

Now we loop:
Is [number] > 1000?
yes --> prepend M and subtract 1000 from [number]

now, result = "M"
number that still needs translating: "596"
is the remainder greater than 500? YES
subtract 500, and append "D" to results

now result = "MD",
and we still need to translate "96"

is remainder > 100? NO
skip this condition

is remainder > 50? YES

subtract 50 from remainder, 
append "L" to result

result = "MDL"
remaining number = "46"

is remainder > 10? YES
append "X" to result
(Repeat this until remainder < 10)

Result = "MDLXXXX",
remainder = "6"

....other stuff....
result = "MDLXXXXVI"
remainder = 0! Done!

9=IX
4=IV
